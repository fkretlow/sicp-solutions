Exercise 1.34
=============

Suppose we define the procedure ``(define (f g) (g 2))``. Then we have::

    (f square)
    4
    (f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
    6

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination ``(f f)``? Explain.

Easy. The interpreter complains that 2 is not appliccable: ``(f f) = (f 2) = (2 2)``, which doesn't make sense.
