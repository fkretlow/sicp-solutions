Midway through the first part I have decided to collate my solutions to the exercises in [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) in this repository. You write better code if there is a possibility that someone else might actually read it.

I will clean up and upload what I have so far as time permits. I plan to solve and upload one exercise a day from now on.
